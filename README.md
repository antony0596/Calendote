#Calendote#

I don't like the note applications that I've come across. I want to make one that allows me to have a calendar, to do list, and notes, all in one single application.

I want to be able to take general notes and have to do lists without a specific date, as well as have notes and to do lists for the day, week, month, and year.

I don't want to have the application be persistent in the foreground or have to minimize it. I want to be able to open it up and have it be a small window that I can move around and resize.

I want to have a keyboard shortcut that will allow me to show or hide the application. I want to be able to have the application be hidden by default and then show it when I want to use it. Closing it would hide it again. Basically minimize to tray.
