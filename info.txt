I'm still learning. So this is just a place for myself to keep track of things that are new to me at the time of writing the program.

I have some experience with web development. HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Currently learning Python. I don't like the outdated look of TKinter.

Apparently I can make the UI with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and use Eel to act as an intermediary. Where Python is the backend.

Welp... I just realized that this uses web browsers to run. In hindsight, it is obvious. However, I want the application to be lightweight. I guess I just got too excited about learning Python that I didn't stop to think. 

Maybe I should do this in C#. I think it may make it more lightweight. Specially since this is going to be a Windows application. At least for the time being. I'm developing this for personal reasons and I don't f*** with Apple. I don't know how well a C# application would run on Apple devices, and at this point in time, I honestly don't care.
